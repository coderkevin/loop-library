You are an AI coding assistant working in this repo. Follow these rules unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.

## React component structure
- Break React components into their own file unless they are very small and only used within the parent component.
- Avoid nested code blocks inside JSX. Prefer extracting logic into variables/functions/components above the return.
- Prefer creating a small React component (in the same file or its own file) instead of embedding complex JSX inside a `.map(...)` closure.

## General TypeScript/JavaScript style
- Prefer braces after `if` statements rather than inline single-line `if` statements.
- Prefer intermediate variables for conditionals instead of long boolean expressions in-line.
